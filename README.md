# Example Gratitude App Solution

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d40e2ab1-025c-4b40-a2e8-958170232368/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gratijournal/deploys)

Deployed App Demo: https://gratijournal.netlify.app/

This is a potential solution to the Gratitude Journal assignment brief (your's may be implemented differently, or use a much different style). We will build upon our static, unpersisted site to learn how to use local storage as a quick way to persist data, and then how to connect to supabase for authentication and a backend. 

You can either follow along in class by forking and cloning this repository, or use my example repo as a model for adapting your own solution to have persistant data.

#### Template

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) and the styled-components template:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-styled-components with-styled-components-app
```


## Running Locally
After **forking** this repository, you can clone it to your local computer, install all dependencies, and then start the development server.
```bash
// clone your forked repo, get the URL from the green clone button
git clone PATH_TO_REPO

// install dependencies (run from the root directory of the repo)
npm install 

// start development server locally
npm run dev
```
